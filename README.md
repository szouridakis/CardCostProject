# CardCostProject

A small spring boot project exposing some APIs. 
The main functionality is to return the clearing cost from the internal database, by retrieving the issuing country from the public API https://bintable.com/get-api , given the card number as input.

The API documentation can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/17tUe6noea6bKRCPSbkx8hrIj48aHBnvR/view?usp=share_link
